Cosigt (COsine SImilarity-based GenoTyper) is a [small tool](cosigt.go) and a [snakemake pipeline](cosigt_smk/README.md) capable to assign structural haplotypes (that is, genotype) to sequenced samples using pangenome graphs. An initial explanation of the rationale behind cosigt is detailed in this manuscript [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07911-1#Sec5). 

> [!NOTE]  
> We are currently finalising the pipeline and the documentation and we hope to release it with the community soon!
